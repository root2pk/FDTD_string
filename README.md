# FDTD_StiffString_Simulation
Simulation of a stiff string with a FDTD model and a simple six-string guitar.

Created as part of the Physics based modelling of musical instruments course.

Run `Six_String_FDTD.m` to play the six strings of a guitar in standard tuning.

`Parallel.m` takes advantage of multi-core processing to speed up the same algorithm

`Chor_Program.m` allows the user to play chords with various adjustable parameters.
